# matched GWAS

## Overview  
The R package `matchedGWAS` is developed to conduct Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) with paired samples, where cases are genotyped from tumor tissues and controls come from normal tissues of the same patients. Most traditional GWAS  focus on independent case-control design. To address the limitation of current GWAS, this method is proposed to accommodate the structure of paired data to identify genetic variants or DNA segments that are associated with cancers.
